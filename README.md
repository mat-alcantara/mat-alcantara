Studying software development every single day since september 2019.

Passionate about technology and programming. I like to use my skills to create products who have potencial to help people lives become easier.

“We believe people with passion can change the world for the better. That’s what we believe. And we believe that those people who are crazy enough to think they can change the world are the ones that actually do.”
